User Authentication & Management:
Registration:
    Firebase Auth creates user with email/password
    User gets unique Firebase UID
    Additional user data (handle, name, etc.) stored in Realtime DB: users/{handle}
    Structure includes: handle, uid, email, name, phone, role, createdOn
Login:
    Firebase Auth handles email/password verification
    Returns user object with UID
    App fetches additional user data from users/{handle}
 
User Management:
    Users can be searched by handle or email
    Roles can be updated: users/{handle}/role
    User data stored by handle for easy lookup
    Post Operations:
 
Creating Posts:
    Stored in posts/{postId}
Structure includes:
    title, content, userId
    likes: 0 (initial count)
    comments: [] (empty array)
    createdOn, lastActivityDate
    upvotes/downvotes objects
Deleting Posts:
    Removes entire post node: posts/{postId}
    Handled atomically to prevent partial deletions
 
Voting System:
    Structure:
    posts/{postId}/
    upvotes/{userId}: true
    downvotes/{userId}: true
    Logic:
    Uses transactions to prevent race conditions
    Clicking same vote removes it
    Switching vote removes old and adds new
    Updates lastActivityDate
